# 2048

With a little bit of Tkinter GUI tinkering, I created a playable 2048 game that we all loved to play when it was popular. Although, there's a catch that makes this game a little bit different. I always found it difficult to beat the 2048 game at times, so I decided to train an Artificial Intelligence Agent which utilizes the Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm from [Stabe Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/ppo.html) that learns to beat the 2048 Game. Test out your skills against the Agents by playing!

## Installation

Open your terminal, then copy & paste the command in your desired directory location

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrew011002/2048-AI
```

## Running
Getting the game up and going is as simple as opening main.py and running it!
